# Nuvla Clojure Client Library

Nuvla clojure client library to interact with the Nuvla REST API.

## Building

To build everything, just do the usual maven dance:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

This will trigger the full build via leiningen.  You can also do the
build directly with leiningen:

```sh
lein do clean, test, install
```

All artifacts will be put into your local maven repository.  

## Deploying Artifacts

To push (deploy) the build artifacts to the maven repository hosted in
AWS S3, you must define the following environmental variables:

 - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: value of the AWS secret key
 - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: value of the AWS access key

To add these to the Travis CI configuration, the commands are:

```sh
travis encrypt AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<value> --add env.global --com
travis encrypt AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<value> --add env.global --com 
```

The updated `.travis.yml` file will need to be pushed into the git
repository.  The same commands can be used to change the credentials.
Be sure to delete the previous definitions from the `.travis.yml`
file.
